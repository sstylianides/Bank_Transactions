# Bank_Transactions
program allows the user to make some simple banking transactions

Objective: This program allows the user to make some simple banking transactions.
 It will first prompt the user to enter the current balance of their bank
 account (in dollars and cents, not less than zero). The program will
 then prompt the user to enter the number of withdrawals to make, and then
 the number of deposits to make (max 5). It will also give errors if words,
 negative numbers are used. Will also not allow the user to withdraw more than
 they have in their account
